# Moderation Guidelines (draft)

## Be reasonable

Contributors to Bitcoin Core come to the project to collaborate because they want to make a positive contribution to the project. Uncivil behavior in this volunteer software project endangers its sustainability by decreasing the intrinsic motivation of contributors, reducing their productivity, and heightening dropout rates. If you come to the project to spam, troll or leave insults and threats, you will be moderated. Disagreements are to be expected but the baseline assumption is that contributors are polite, stay on topic and avoid incendiary or offensive language. There are other forums outside of this code repository for debates and controversies. This repository is a place to discuss code. 

If contributors treat each other with basic decency, this project will be a happier and more productive place to work. Think carefully about the way you handle communication in the project â€” make sure it is useful, and that it doesn't make other contributors' jobs harder.

## Role of Moderators

Members of the Bitcoin organization will be helpful in reporting and flagging misbehavior. Volunteer moderators will review flagged posts as well as spot check other conversations to determine whether the posts in question should be hidden, deleted, or left as is.

Some rationale to determine the proper course of action might depend on whether the post is:
* Off topic
* About people, not ideas
* Abusive
* Profane

## Infraction consequences

Moderators will act on bad behavior when it is seen.

Spam will be deleted and those accounts will be reported to GitHub. Users who are determined to create an account in order to leave inflammatory comments on controversial topics will also have their comment either hidden or deleted and may be blocked from the Bitcoin organization.

Moderators may lock controversial conversations or limit it to prior contributors or members of the Bitcoin organization.

Moderators may reach out to contributors to ask them to self-moderate. In requesting self-moderation from contributors, moderators may ask for specific actions like editing or deleting the post in question, so as to avoid public shaming directed at the author or other escalations. Apologies may also be in order.

If that fails, moderators will use warnings, timeouts and bans at increasing rates based on prior patterns of behavior. Usually mildly uncivil behavior (such as being off-topic/disruptive or rudeness) will result in a warning or temporary ban (in the order of days). Longer term bans may result from repeated or frequent violations. Moderators will consult with maintainers before making any bans longer than 1 week.
